# luxury_watches

I will import a .csv file of luxury watches.

First step will be to extract Brand Name, Watch Name, YOP, and Price.

After Displaying these, I will then create a model to show the prices and structure baseed on brand and percent of brand, etc.

Then train a regression model to display prices and predict for future research for which wathces to buy.
